## Growth Mindset 

**I believe that skills and intelligence can be grown and developed.**  

**People who are good at something, they are good because they built that ability.** 

**People who aren't good at something, they are not good because they haven't spent time and effort to build that skill.** 

## I keep myself in a growth mindset when I 
* View challenges as opportunities.
* Make a new goal for every goal accomplished. 
* Reward my self and others
