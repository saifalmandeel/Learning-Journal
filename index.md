## Growth Mindset 

**I believe that skills and intelligence are growth and developed. 
People who are good at something, they believe skills are built - are good because they built that ability.
People who aren't good at something, they believe skills are born and are not good because they haven't done the work.** 

## I keep myself in a growth mindset when I 
* View challenges as opportunities.
* Make a new goal for every goal accomplished. 
* Reward my self and others
